📌 Project Overview

XAI is a high-fidelity, single-page interactive product experience that visually demonstrates how raw data transforms into actionable insights using AI.

The goal of this project is to simulate a production-level AI SaaS interface that:

1. Clearly communicates complex data flow

2. Demonstrates intentional motion and interaction design

3. Reflects engineering discipline and UI polish

4. Feels calm, confident, and decision-maker focused


 🧠 Technical Approach

The project is built as a modular, component-based architecture with:

Structured UI sections representing the AI pipeline (Raw Data → Processing → Insights).
Intentional animation flow to guide user attention.
Clean separation of layout, logic, and interaction layers.
State-driven UI transitions for clarity and maintainability.

Animations are purpose-driven, not decorative. Each motion reinforces system understanding.
